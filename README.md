# Blog-platform-springboot-react
Engineered a secure full-stack blog platform with Spring Boot and React, featuring JWT authentication, REST APIs, and role-based access control.
Blog Platform - Spring Boot & ReactA secure, full-stack, and scalable blog platform engineered with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This project features robust JWT-based authentication, comprehensive REST APIs, and fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC). The application is containerized using Docker for streamlined deployment and development.üìã Table of ContentsArchitectural Overview‚ú® Key Featuresüõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack‚öôÔ∏è Project StructureüöÄ Getting StartedPrerequisitesInstallation & Setupüê≥ Docker Deploymentüîë Environment Variablesü§ù ContributingüìÑ LicenseüèõÔ∏è Architectural OverviewThe application follows a classic client-server architecture. The React frontend acts as the client, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. It communicates with the Spring Boot backend through a set of RESTful APIs. The backend handles all business logic, data persistence, and security. PostgreSQL is used as the relational database to store user data, blog posts, and other application-related information.+-----------------+      +------------------------+      +------------------+

‚ú® Key FeaturesFull-Stack Application: A complete, end-to-end solution with a modern frontend and a robust backend.User Authentication: Secure user registration and login system using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Different user roles (e.g., USER, ADMIN) with distinct permissions for managing content.RESTful API: A well-defined API for seamless communication between the frontend and backend.CRUD Operations: Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for blog posts.Containerized: Fully configured with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for easy setup and deployment.Scalable & Maintainable: Built with a clean and organized codebase, following best practices.üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackBackendFramework: Spring Boot 3Language: Java 17Security: Spring Security, JWTDatabase: PostgreSQLORM: Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)API: Spring Web (REST controllers)Build Tool: MavenFrontendLibrary: React 18State Management: Redux (or Context API)Routing: React RouterAPI Client: AxiosStyling: Tailwind CSS / Material-UI (or specify your choice)DevOpsContainerization: Docker, Docker Compose‚öôÔ∏è Project StructureThe Spring Boot backend is organized into a modular and layered architecture to ensure separation of concerns and maintainability.Note: Please replace the image URL above with a direct link to the screenshot in your repository for it to render correctly.src/main/java/com/prabhat/blogconfig: Houses configuration classes, such as SecurityConfig.controllers: Contains REST API endpoint definitions that handle incoming HTTP requests.domain: Defines JPA entities (the models) that map to database tables.mappers: DTO (Data Transfer Object) mappers for converting between entities and DTOs.repositories: Spring Data JPA interfaces for database operations.security: JWT token generation, validation, and filter configurations.services: Contains the business logic of the application.üöÄ Getting StartedFollow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.PrerequisitesJDK 17+Maven 3.8+Node.js 18+ & npmDocker & Docker ComposeA running instance of PostgreSQLInstallation & SetupClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blog-platform-springboot-react.git](https://github.com/your-username/blog-platform-springboot-react.git)
cd blog-platform-springboot-react
Configure Backend:Navigate to the backend directory.Create a copy of application.properties.example and rename it to application.properties.Update application.properties with your PostgreSQL database credentials and JWT secret key (see Environment Variables).Run the backend application:mvn spring-boot:run
The backend will be running on http://localhost:8080.Configure Frontend:Navigate to the frontend directory.Install dependencies:npm install
Start the development server:npm start
The frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000.üê≥ Docker DeploymentThe simplest way to run the entire application stack is by using Docker Compose.Clone the repository (if you haven't already).Create your environment file:In the root directory, create a .env file.Add the necessary environment variables for the database and JWT configuration. See the .env.example file for reference.Build and run with Docker Compose:docker-compose up --build
This command will build the images for the backend, frontend, and database and start the containers.Backend API will be available at http://localhost:8080Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000üîë Environment VariablesTo run this project, you will need to configure the following environment variables in your application.properties (for local development) or .env file (for Docker).# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/blogdb
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# JWT Secret Key
# Use a long, random, and secure string for this
jwt.secret=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt_tokens

# JWT Expiration Time (in milliseconds)
jwt.expiration=86400000 # 24 hours
