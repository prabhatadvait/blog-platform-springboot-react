## Blog Platform - Spring Boot & React
A secure, full-stack, and scalable blog platform engineered with Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This project features robust JWT-based authentication, comprehensive REST APIs, and fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC). The application is containerized using Docker for streamlined deployment and development.

üèõÔ∏è Architectural Overview
The application follows a classic client-server architecture. The React frontend acts as the client, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. It communicates with the Spring Boot backend through a set of RESTful APIs. The backend handles all business logic, data persistence, and security. PostgreSQL is used as the relational database to store user data, blog posts, and other application-related information.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
JDK 17+

Maven 3.8+

Node.js 18+ & npm

Docker & Docker Compose

A running instance of PostgreSQL

Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/blog-platform-springboot-react.git](https://github.com/your-username/blog-platform-springboot-react.git)
cd blog-platform-springboot-react

Configure Backend:

Navigate to the backend directory.

Create a copy of application.properties.example and rename it to application.properties.

Update application.properties with your PostgreSQL database credentials and JWT secret key (see Environment Variables).

Run the backend application:

mvn spring-boot:run

The backend will be running on http://localhost:8080.

Configure Frontend:

Navigate to the frontend directory.

Install dependencies:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm start

The frontend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

üê≥ Docker Deployment
The simplest way to run the entire application stack is by using Docker Compose.

Clone the repository (if you haven't already).

Create your environment file:

In the root directory, create a .env file.

Add the necessary environment variables for the database and JWT configuration. See the .env.example file for reference.

Build and run with Docker Compose:

docker-compose up --build

This command will build the images for the backend, frontend, and database and start the containers.

Backend API will be available at http://localhost:8080

Frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

üîë Environment Variables
To run this project, you will need to configure the following environment variables in your application.properties (for local development) or .env file (for Docker).

# PostgreSQL Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/blogdb
spring.datasource.username=your_db_user
spring.datasource.password=your_db_password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# JWT Secret Key
# Use a long, random, and secure string for this
jwt.secret=your_super_secret_key_for_jwt_tokens

# JWT Expiration Time (in milliseconds)
jwt.expiration=86400000 # 24 hours
